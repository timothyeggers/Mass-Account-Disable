# Mass-Account-Disable
A tool used to manage client user accounts for our project managers.  

 * Author: Timothy Eggers
 * Purpose: We needed to be able to mass disable accounts at the end of the month that were inactive in an application called Relativity
 * In Relativity we would filter by last activity and pull a report into a text file, which could then be parsed in here and have accounts disabled.
 * People using this tool have a front end user interface (in our system administrator team) so wouldnt need to have coding knowledge ot use this 
 * very specific-purpose tool. 
 * 
 * How to use:
 * Usage of Mass Account Disable tool
 * 1) Create text file with users seperated by a new line
 * 2) Save the file, and open it up in this tool.  Once the text file is loaded in the tool click Run
 * 3) If any user accounts failed to pop up, it'll notify you of each one and will require manual cleanup
